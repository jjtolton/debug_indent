> /read-emacs is running… A lot of debug info slipped into the double dollar sign Term expansion. Can you fix that for me? 

● I'll retrieve the selected region from your Emacs buffer to see what needs to be fixed.

● slopmacs - as_user_eval (MCP)(sexp: "(format \"FILE: %s\\nBUFFER: %s\\nLINES: %d-%d\\n\\n%s\"\n        (or (buffer-file-name) \"no file\")\n        (buffer-name)\n

● I can see the debug output from the ediprolog history buffer. The issue is that debug info is showing up during term expansion. Let me look at the actual source file to find where the
  $$ operator is being expanded:

● Read(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Read 135 lines

● I can see the issue! The term_expansion/2 rule on lines 65-73 is printing debug information whenever it expands clauses containing the $$ operator. The debug output shows:
  - Line 67: format("~n[TERM EXPANSION] Expanding: ~q~n", [Head])
  - Line 70: format("[TERM EXPANSION] Module: ~q, LineNo: ~q~n", [Module, LineNo])
  - Lines 72-73: Two more format statements showing Body0 and Body

  I'll remove these debug print statements:

● Update(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Updated debug_indent.pl with 1 addition and 5 removals                                    
       64    
       65    user:term_expansion((Head :- Body0), (Head :- Body)) :-
       66        user:contains_debug_op(Body0),
       67 -      format("~n[TERM EXPANSION] Expanding: ~q~n", [Head]),
       67        prolog_load_context(module, Module),
       68        prolog_load_context(term_position, position_and_lines_read(_CharPos, LineNo)),
       69 -      format("[TERM EXPANSION] Module: ~q, LineNo: ~q~n", [Module, LineNo]),
       70 -      user:expand_body(Body0, Module, LineNo, Body),
       71 -      format("[TERM EXPANSION] Body0: ~q~n", [Body0]),
       72 -      format("[TERM EXPANSION] Body:  ~q~n~n", [Body]).
       69 +      user:expand_body(Body0, Module, LineNo, Body).
       70    
       71    
       72    

● Perfect! I've removed all the debug format statements from the term_expansion/2 rule in debug_indent.pl:65-69. The term expansion will now happen silently without printing all that
  debug information about expanding clauses, module names, line numbers, and body transformations.

  The term expansion functionality remains intact - it still detects clauses with $$ operators and expands them properly, just without the verbose output.

> /read-emacs is running… Can you help diagnose this, please? [Image #1] 

● I'll retrieve the selected region from your Emacs buffer and help diagnose the issue shown in the screenshot.

● slopmacs - as_user_eval (MCP)(sexp: "(format \"FILE: %s\\nBUFFER: %s\\nLINES: %d-%d\\n\\n%s\"\n        (or (buffer-file-name) \"no file\")\n        (buffer-name)\n
                               (line-number-at-pos (region-beginning))\n        (line-number-at-pos (region-end))\n        (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))")
  ⎿ {                                                                                                                                                                                    
      "result": "\"FILE: /home/jay/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/test_support_predicates.pl\nBUFFER: test_support_predicates.pl\nLINES: 40-43\n\n?- Alpha = location(a)@[5]:[loc
    1,loc2],\n   Phi = [[location(a)@[0,10]:[loc1]], []],\n   assertion_chronicle_delta(Alpha, Phi, Delta).\n\""
    }


● Now let me read the actual file to understand the context better:

● Read(~/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/test_support_predicates.pl)
  ⎿  Read 294 lines

● I can see the issue! Looking at the error in your screenshot and the selected region from your Emacs buffer:

  Selected region (test_support_predicates.pl:40-43):
  ?- Alpha = location(a)@[5]:[loc1,loc2],
     Phi = [[location(a)@[0,10]:[loc1]], []],
     assertion_chronicle_delta(Alpha, Phi, Delta).

  Error message in screenshot:
  error(type_error(atom,pgk(debug_indent)),must_be/2).

  The issue is on line 5 of the test file:

  :- use_module(pgk(debug_indent)).

  It should be pkg (package), not pgk! This is a typo that's causing the type error because Scryer Prolog is expecting an atom but getting the compound term pgk(debug_indent).

  Let me fix this:

● Update(~/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/test_support_predicates.pl)
  ⎿  Updated ../../_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/test_support_predicates.pl with 1 addition and 1 removal
       2    :- use_module(library(clpz)).
       3    :- use_module(library(lists)).
       4    :- use_module('../bakage.pl').
       5 -  :- use_module(pgk(debug_indent)).
       5 +  :- use_module(pkg(debug_indent)).
       6    
       7    % Test predicates for assertion/chronicle support system
       8    % This file tests the new support predicates introduced in the refactoring

● Perfect! I've fixed the typo. The error was on test_support_predicates.pl:5 where pgk(debug_indent) should have been pkg(debug_indent).

  The type error occurred because Prolog module system expects library references to follow a specific format, and the misspelled pgk was being interpreted incorrectly, causing the
  type_error(atom,pgk(debug_indent)) error.

  Now your query should work properly!

> Thumbs up! 

● Great! I'm glad that fixed the issue. The query should now load properly without the type error. Happy coding!

> You know, I realized it would be better if all of the logging lines were proper prologue terms. 

● Good idea! That would make the debug output more structured and potentially useful for other tools. Currently, the logging in debug_indent.pl uses format/2 with string formatting.
  Would you like me to:

  1. Define a custom predicate like debug_log/1 or trace_log/1 that outputs proper Prolog terms
  2. Replace the current format calls with portray_clause/1 or write_canonical/1 for the trace messages
  3. Create a structured term format like trace(counter, event, module, line, goal) for each trace entry

  Which approach would you prefer, or did you have something else in mind?

> Let's go with options two and three, but keep the indenting. What exactly does event mean? I don't think we had a vent in the original. Or is that just like error, etc? 

● You're right - I should clarify! By "event" I meant the type of trace point: call, exit, or exception (the three types we currently have in the code on lines 114, 122, and 128).

  So for option 3, the structured term would be something like:

  trace(N, call, Module, LineNo, Goal)
  trace(N, exit, Module, LineNo, Goal)
  trace(N, exception, Module, LineNo, Goal)

  Where:
  - N is the counter
  - The second argument is call, exit, or exception
  - Module and LineNo are the source location
  - Goal is the actual goal being traced

  And we'd use portray_clause/1 to output these as proper Prolog terms while keeping the indentation. Does that sound right?

> Let's try it and see how it goes 

● Read(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Read 131 lines

● Now I'll update the '$$-'/3 predicate to output proper Prolog terms while keeping the indentation:

● Update(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Updated debug_indent.pl with 3 additions and 6 removals

       111 -      portray_clause(G_0),
       110 +      portray_clause(trace(N, call, Module, LineNo, G_0)),
       111        '$inc_depth'(D, _D1),
       112        catch(
       113              (
       114                  G_0,
       115                  '$dec_depth'(D),
       116                  '$indent',
       117 -                format("~w] exit (~w:~w): ", [N, Module, LineNo]),
       118 -                portray_clause(G_0)
       117 +                portray_clause(trace(N, exit, Module, LineNo, G_0))
       118              ),
       119            Ex,
       120              (   '$dec_depth'(D),
       121                  '$indent',
       122 -                format("~w] exception (~w:~w): ", [N, Module, LineNo]),
       123 -                portray_clause(Ex:G_0),
       122 +                portray_clause(trace(N, exception, Module, LineNo, Ex, G_0)),
       123                  throw(Ex)
       124              )
       125        ).

● Perfect! I've updated the debug output to use proper Prolog terms. Now the trace output will be:

  - For calls: trace(N, call, Module, LineNo, Goal).
  - For exits: trace(N, exit, Module, LineNo, Goal).
  - For exceptions: trace(N, exception, Module, LineNo, Exception, Goal).

  Each line will still be indented according to the trace depth (2 spaces per level), but now they're all valid Prolog terms that could be read back in, parsed, or processed by other
  tools. The portray_clause/1 will format them nicely with proper syntax.

> For clarity, let's change it to module colon line number 

● Update(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Updated debug_indent.pl with 3 additions and 3 removals

       110 -      portray_clause(trace(N, call, Module, LineNo, G_0)),
       110 +      portray_clause(trace(N, call, Module:LineNo, G_0)),
       111        '$inc_depth'(D, _D1),
       112        catch(
       113              (
       114                  G_0,
       115                  '$dec_depth'(D),
       116                  '$indent',
       117 -                portray_clause(trace(N, exit, Module, LineNo, G_0))
       117 +                portray_clause(trace(N, exit, Module:LineNo, G_0))
       118              ),
       119            Ex,

       123                  throw(Ex)
       124              )
       125        ).

● Done! Now the trace output will use the clearer Module:LineNo format:

  - For calls: trace(N, call, Module:LineNo, Goal).
  - For exits: trace(N, exit, Module:LineNo, Goal).
  - For exceptions: trace(N, exception, Module:LineNo, Exception, Goal).

  This makes it more readable and follows the common Prolog convention for indicating source locations.

> And let's make it id:N.

       117 -                portray_clause(trace(N, exit, Module:LineNo, G_0))
       117 +                portray_clause(trace(id:N, exit, Module:LineNo, G_0))
       118              ),
       119            Ex,
       120              (   '$dec_depth'(D),
       121                  '$indent',

       124              )
       125        ).

● Perfect! Now the trace output will be:

  - For calls: trace(id:N, call, Module:LineNo, Goal).
  - For exits: trace(id:N, exit, Module:LineNo, Goal).
  - For exceptions: trace(id:N, exception, Module:LineNo, Exception, Goal).

  This makes both the ID and the location very clear and readable.

       75 +  All trace output is formatted as proper Prolog terms for easy parsing and processing:
       76 +  
       77 +  ```prolog
       78 +  trace(id:0, call, example:6, 3>0).
       79 +  trace(id:0, exit, example:6, 3>0).

       93 -      3] exit (example:6): 2>0.
       94 -      ...
       95 -  ```
       87    
       88 +  Each trace term contains:
       89 +  - `id:N` - Unique identifier for matching call/exit pairs
       90 +  - Event type - `call`, `exit`, or `exception`
       91 +  - `Module:LineNo` - Source location
       92 +  - The goal being traced
       93 +  - For exceptions: `trace(id:N, exception, Module:LineNo, Exception, Goal)`
       94 +

  ⎿  To github.com:jjtolton/debug_indent.git
        4c0ac92..caf2c32  master -> master

● Perfect! I've successfully:

  1. ✅ Removed the verbose debug output from term expansion
  2. ✅ Refactored trace output to use proper Prolog terms with the format:
    - trace(id:N, call, Module:LineNo, Goal)
    - trace(id:N, exit, Module:LineNo, Goal)
    - trace(id:N, exception, Module:LineNo, Exception, Goal)
  3. ✅ Updated the README with the new output format and detailed documentation
  4. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive commit message
  5. ✅ Pushed to the remote repository

  The trace output is now fully structured as Prolog terms while maintaining the indented visual hierarchy for easy reading.

> Is the double dollar sign operator at least stubbed out somewhere still? 

● Let me check the current state of the file:

● Read(debug_indent.pl)
  ⎿  Read 128 lines

● Yes! The $$ operator is still stubbed out on line 22:

  %% to keep the compiler happy
  '$$'(_).

  This stub is still there and serves as a fallback clause. It ensures that if $$ is somehow called directly at runtime (rather than being transformed by term expansion), the compiler
  won't complain about an undefined predicate. The term expansion mechanism (lines 46, 65-69) transforms all $$ Goal occurrences into '$$-'(Goal, Module, LineNo) at compile time, so this
   stub should rarely if ever be invoked during normal operation.

> Are the operators properly exported? 

● Yes, the operators are properly exported! Looking at lines 1-6:

  :- module(debug_indent, [
      op(900, fx, $$),
      ($$)/1,
      ('$$-')/3,
      reset_trace_depth/0
  ]).

  The module exports:
  1. op(900, fx, $$) - The operator declaration itself
  2. ($$)/1 - The predicate (the stub on line 22)
  3. ('$$-')/3 - The internal predicate used after term expansion
  4. reset_trace_depth/0 - The utility predicate

  This is correct! When other modules do :- use_module(pkg(debug_indent)), they'll get the $$ operator definition and can use it in their code. The term expansion happens in the user
  module (lines 24-69), so it will automatically transform $$ expressions in any module that imports this one.

● Context: quad_cp_action_step.pl:54-257

  Great! The trace output shows that your goals are successfully executing. Looking at the trace output, I can see:

  ?- interpret_rules(setup_move_operator_tripple),
  K1^Goals1^Pi1^Phi1+\(
      Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,T0]:[loc1]], []],
      Goals=[X@Ts:V],
      K=[],
      Pi=[],
      Omega0=[Phi,Goals,K,Pi],
      init_chronicle(Phi),
      init_goals(Goals),
      cp_action_step(Omega0, Omega),
      Omega=[Phi1,Goals1,K1,Pi1]
  ).

  The trace output is working beautifully with proper Prolog terms! You can see the execution flow with:
  - trace(id:0, call, schedule:72, ...) showing each call
  - trace(id:0, exit, schedule:72, ...) showing successful exits
  - Proper indentation showing the call depth hierarchy

  The trace shows that:
  1. init_chronicle/1 is calling f/2 and maplist/2
  2. init_goals/1 is setting up assertions with domain establishment
  3. cp_action_step/2 is being executed with the regression branch (alpha_supported_chronicle/3)
  4. Constraint compatibility checking is happening via chronicle_constraints_compatible/1

  This confirms that the refactored trace output format is working perfectly - all output is valid Prolog terms while maintaining readability through indentation!

> Great, given the general goals that we saw can you create some specific ones for a more concrete  example? 

● Looking at the trace output, I can see the query is using existential quantification with +\ and has very general variables. Let me create some concrete examples based on the move
  operator pattern I saw in the test files.

  Let me first check what's in the quad_cp_action_step.pl file to understand the setup:

● Read(~/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/quad_cp_action_step.pl)
  ⎿  Read 55 lines

● Perfect! I can see there's already a concrete example on lines 40-51. Let me read more to see what was in your selection and create additional concrete examples:

● Read(~/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/quad_cp_action_step.pl)
  ⎿  Read 2 lines

● So the file only goes to line 55. Based on the trace output you showed me (which said lines 54-257), it appears the query at line 54 was the very general one with Goals=[X@Ts:V]. Let
  me add some concrete examples after the existing one:

● Perfect! I've added three concrete examples to quad_cp_action_step.pl:

  Example 1 (lines 53-66): Robot at loc1, wants to transition to loc2 at time 5
  - Initial state: location(rob)@[0,10]:[loc1] (robot persists at loc1 from 0 to 10)
  - Goal: location(rob)@[5]:[loc1,loc2] (transition event from loc1 to loc2 at time 5)
  - Should succeed via regression since loc1 and loc2 are adjacent

  Example 2 (lines 68-81): Robot at loc1, wants to persist at loc2
  - Initial state: location(rob)@[0,10]:[loc1]
  - Goal: location(rob)@[5,8]:[loc2] (persist at loc2 from time 5 to 8)
  - Should require finding a move action from loc1 to loc2

  Example 3 (lines 83-96): Robot at loc1, wants to reach loc3
  - Initial state: location(rob)@[0,10]:[loc1]
  - Goal: location(rob)@[8,10]:[loc3] (persist at loc3 from time 8 to 10)
  - Requires multi-step planning: loc1→loc2→loc3 (since adjacency is loc1↔loc2↔loc3)

  These concrete examples should produce clearer trace output showing the different planning strategies (regression vs. action application).

● Perfect! I can see the two versions you have:

  quad_cp_action_step.pl:37-70

  Version 1 - Semi-concrete (lines 37-51):
  ?- interpret_rules(setup_move_operator_tripple),
  K1^Goals1^Pi1^Phi1+\(
      Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,T0]:[loc1]], []],

      init_goals(Goals),
      cp_action_step(Omega0, Omega),
      Omega=[Phi1,Goals1,K1,Pi1]
  ).
  - Has a concrete initial chronicle: robot at loc1
  - Has a general goal: any assertion X@Ts:V
  - Shows 2 solutions with different patterns

  Version 2 - Very general (lines 55-70):
  ?- interpret_rules(setup_move_operator_tripple),
  K1^Goals1^Pi1^Phi1+\(
      Phi=[[X@Ys:Vs], []],  % General chronicle
      Goals=[X@Ts:V],       % General goal
      K=[],
      Pi=[],
      Omega0=[Phi,Goals,K,Pi],

      init_goals(Goals),
      cp_action_step(Omega0, Omega),
      Omega=[Phi1,Goals1,K1,Pi1]
  ).
  - Completely general: both chronicle and goals are variables
  - Shows 4 different solution patterns
  - Demonstrates all possible ways cp_action_step can succeed

  The concrete examples I added would slot in nicely between these, showing specific instantiations with concrete locations and times. Would you like me to reorder them or adjust
  anything about the examples I created?

● Perfect! I've created Concrete Example 4 (lines 137-151) based on the solution pattern from line 131:

  Example 4: Robot staying at the same location
  - Initial state: location(rob)@[0,3]:[loc1] - Robot persists at loc1 from time 0 to 3
  - Goal: location(rob)@[3,6]:[loc1] - Robot should persist at loc1 from time 3 to 6
  - Expected pattern: The enabler set should show two consecutive persistence intervals at the same location, matching the pattern location(rob)@[_C,_D]:[_G],location(rob)@[_B,_C]:[_G]
  where _G=loc1, _B=3, _C=6, and the intervals connect at time 3.

  This is a simple continuation case where the robot just continues staying at the same location, demonstrating the regression case where the goal is already supported by the chronicle
  (or a simple extension of it).

● Ah, good question! Let me analyze all 4 solution patterns from lines 131-135. Looking more carefully at the enabler sets:

  Solution 1 (line 131):
  - K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[_C,_D]:[_G],location(rob)@[_B,_C]:[_G]],...]]
  - Two persistence assertions at the same location _G
  - Time intervals connect: [_B,_C] then [_C,_D]
  - This is the "stay at same place" pattern I described

  Solution 2 (line 132):
  - K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[_C]:[_D,_E],location(rob)@[_B,_C]:[_D]],...]]
  - First: persistence at _D (time [_B,_C])
  - Second: transition event at time _C from _D to _E (with dif(_D,_E))
  - This is "persist then move" pattern

  Solution 3 (line 133):
  - K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[_C,_E]:[_B],location(rob)@[_D,_C]:[_B]],...]]
  - Phi1 starts with transition event: location(rob)@[_D]:[_A,_B] (with dif(_A,_B))
  - Two persistences at location _B
  - This is "transition event in initial chronicle, then persist at destination"

  Solution 4 (line 134):
  - K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[_F]:[_B,_C],location(rob)@[_G,_F]:[_B]],...]]
  - Phi1 starts with transition: location(rob)@[_G]:[_A,_B] (with dif(_A,_B))
  - Persistence then transition event
  - Multiple dif constraints suggesting complex movement

  So no, they don't all represent staying at the same place! They represent different patterns of movement and persistence. Would you like me to create concrete examples for each of
  these 4 patterns?

● Perfect! I've added concrete examples for all 4 solution patterns:

  Example 4 (lines 137-152) - Pattern 1:
  - Same location persistence chain
  - Robot at loc1 [0,3], goal: persist at loc1 [3,6]
  - Simple continuation at same location

  Example 5 (lines 154-169) - Pattern 2:
  - Persistence followed by transition event
  - Robot at loc1 [0,3], goal: transition from loc1→loc2 at time 5
  - Requires maintaining loc1 then moving

  Example 6 (lines 171-186) - Pattern 3:
  - Transition event in initial state, then persist at destination
  - Robot transitions loc1→loc2 at time 0, goal: persist at loc2 [3,6]
  - Shows persistence after a transition

  Example 7 (lines 188-203) - Pattern 4:
  - Chain of transitions through intermediate locations
  - Robot transitions loc1→loc2 at time 0, goal: transition loc2→loc3 at time 5
  - Most complex: requires intermediate persistence between two transitions

  These examples should help illustrate the different planning strategies the cp_action_step predicate can take based on the relationship between the initial chronicle and the goals!

● Excellent! All the concrete examples are working perfectly! Looking at the results from quad_cp_action_step.pl:117-212:

  Example 4 (Persistence at same location):
  K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[3,6]:[loc1],location(rob)@[3,3]:[loc1]],[#3#=< #3,loc1=loc1]]]]
  ✅ Two persistences at loc1, connecting at time 3

  Example 5 (Persistence then transition):
  K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[5]:[loc1,loc2],location(rob)@[3,5]:[loc1]],[#3#=< #5,loc1=loc1]]]]
  ✅ Robot persists at loc1 from 3→5, then transitions to loc2 at time 5

  Example 6 (Transition then persistence):
  K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[3,6]:[loc2],location(rob)@[0,3]:[loc2]],[#0#=< #3,loc2=loc2]]]]
  ✅ After transitioning to loc2 at time 0, robot persists there through times [0,3] and [3,6]

  Example 7 (Chained transitions):
  K1 = [[[[location(rob)@[5]:[loc2,loc3],location(rob)@[0,5]:[loc2]],[#0#=< #5,loc2=loc2]]]]
  ✅ After loc1→loc2 transition, robot persists at loc2 from 0→5, then transitions to loc3 at time 5

  Great work! Each example demonstrates a distinct planning pattern, and they all succeed as expected. The trace output with the new proper Prolog term format should make debugging these
   much easier too!

● Ah! Looking at quad_cp_action_step.pl:73-85, this query is failing:

  ?- interpret_rules(setup_move_operator_tripple),
  K1^Goals1^Pi1^Phi1+\(
      Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,T0]:[loc1]], []],
      Goals=[location(rob)@[A,B]:[loc3]],
      K=[],
      Pi=[],
      Omega0=[Phi,Goals,K,Pi],
      init_chronicle(Phi),
      init_goals(Goals),
      cp_action_step(Omega0, Omega),
      Omega=[Phi1,Goals1,K1,Pi1]
  ).
  %@   false.

  The issue is that cp_action_step handles only ONE step at a time, but getting from loc1 to loc3 requires two moves:
  1. loc1 → loc2 (via adjacency)
  2. loc2 → loc3 (via adjacency)

  Looking at the move operator setup:
  facts([adj(loc1,loc2),adj(loc2,loc3)], [reflexive(true)])

  There's no direct adjacency between loc1 and loc3!

  A single cp_action_step can only:
  - Apply regression if the chronicle already supports the goal
  - Apply one action to get closer to the goal

  But it cannot find a multi-step plan in a single call. To reach loc3 from loc1, you'd need to call cp_solve (which repeatedly calls cp_action_step) rather than just a single
  cp_action_step.

  The goal location(rob)@[A,B]:[loc3] (persist at loc3) cannot be achieved in one action step from an initial chronicle where the robot is at loc1, because there's no single action that
  can make that transition.

  Would you like me to add a comment explaining this limitation, or should we change this to use cp_solve instead?

> Well, I understand that but this is only supposed to be one step -- One step towards location one from location three. Looking at the other examples, do any of those follow the action,
 try action pathway, or are those all the regression refinement pathway? 

● Good question! Let me analyze the successful examples to see which pathway they're taking.

  Looking back at the examples that succeeded:

  Example 4: Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,3]:[loc1]], Goals=[location(rob)@[3,6]:[loc1]]
  - Goal: persist at loc1 (same location as Phi)
  - This is regression - the goal location matches the chronicle location

  Example 5: Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,3]:[loc1]], Goals=[location(rob)@[5]:[loc1,loc2]]
  - Goal: transition from loc1 to loc2
  - This is regression - the transition starts from loc1 which is in the chronicle

  Example 6: Phi=[[location(rob)@[0]:[loc1,loc2]], Goals=[location(rob)@[3,6]:[loc2]]
  - Goal: persist at loc2 (destination of the transition in Phi)
  - This is regression - loc2 is already established by the transition

  Example 7: Phi=[[location(rob)@[0]:[loc1,loc2]], Goals=[location(rob)@[5]:[loc2,loc3]]
  - Goal: transition from loc2 to loc3
  - This is regression - loc2 is the destination from the previous transition

  All of them are using regression! None are using the action application pathway.

  For the failing example with Goals=[location(rob)@[A,B]:[loc3]] and Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,T0]:[loc1]]:
  - The goal requires being at loc3
  - The chronicle only has loc1
  - This should trigger the action application pathway to find an action that can support the goal

  The action step should find a move action that produces location(rob)@[...]:[loc3] as an assertion. Let me check the move operator definition again to see why this might be failing.

● Read(~/_project/tai/jlog/src/jlog/wench/tests/quad_cp_action_step.pl)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

● I see! The move operator produces:
  1. location(Block)@[T0]:[From,To] - transition event
  2. location(Block)@[T0,T1]:[To] - persistence at destination

  So a move action that gets the robot to loc3 would produce location(rob)@[T0,T1]:[loc3] as one of its assertions.

  For the goal location(rob)@[A,B]:[loc3], the action application pathway should:
  1. Find that no assertion in Phi supports being at loc3
  2. Look for a move action where To=loc3
  3. Find move([T0,T1], [rob,From,loc3], ...)
  4. Check if the action's preconditions can be satisfied (needs adj(From,loc3) and adj(loc3,From))

  Looking at the adjacencies: adj(loc1,loc2), adj(loc2,loc3) with reflexive(true)

  The only From that satisfies adj(From,loc3) is From=loc2!

  So the action would be move([T0,T1], [rob,loc2,loc3], ...), but this action requires the robot to be at loc2, not loc1!

  The issue is that to apply an action that gets to loc3, you first need to be at loc2, but the chronicle only has the robot at loc1. This is why it fails - even one action step toward
  loc3 requires being at an adjacent location (loc2), which isn't in the chronicle.

  Should we create an example that tries to go from loc1 to loc2 instead, which should succeed via the action pathway?

> No, I'm pretty sure we need this one to work. 

● You're right - this should work via the action application pathway. The action step should:

  1. Recognize that location(rob)@[A,B]:[loc3] is NOT supported by Phi=[[location(rob)@[0,T0]:[loc1]], []]
  2. Find a supporting action: move([T0,T1], [rob,loc2,loc3], ...) that produces location(rob)@[T0,T1]:[loc3]
  3. Add the action's other assertion location(rob)@[T0]:[loc2,loc3] to the open goals
  4. Add enablers to K

  The key is that this creates a new subgoal: now we need to achieve location(rob)@[T0]:[loc2,loc3] (be at loc2). This is one step toward the goal.

  Let me check if there's an issue with the action definition. Looking at line 18, I see dif(From,To) is commented out. But more importantly, let me verify the action requirements are
  correctly specified.

  Could you run this query with trace output so we can see exactly where it's failing? Or would you like me to examine the cp_action_step and chronicle_supporting_action predicates to
  understand why it's not finding the supporting action?

  The fact that all the other examples use regression suggests there might be an issue with the action application branch. Can you show me what the trace output looks like when this
  query fails?

● For a session on 2025-10-25 that covered debug_indent refactoring and cp_action_step test cases, here are some suggestions:

  Concise:
  - 2025-10-25-debug-indent-refactor.md
  - 20251025-trace-output-planning-tests.md

  Descriptive:
  - 2025-10-25-debug-indent-proper-terms-and-cp-tests.md
  - 2025-10-25-prolog-trace-terms-planning-examples.md

  Very specific:
  - 2025-10-25-debug-indent-trace-refactor-quad-cp-action-step.md

  I'd recommend: 2025-10-25-debug-indent-refactor-and-planning-tests.md

  This captures the two main accomplishments: refactoring the debug_indent trace output to use proper Prolog terms, and creating concrete planning test examples for cp_action_step.
